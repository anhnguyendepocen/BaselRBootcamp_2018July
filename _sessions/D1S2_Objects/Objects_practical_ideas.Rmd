## Overview

In this practical you'll learn how to work with basic R objects. By the end of this practical you will know how to:

1. Create vectors of different types using `c()`
2. Understand the three main vector classes numeric, character, and logical using `class()` 
3. Create dataframes (and tibbles!) using `data.frame()` and `tibble()`
4. Access vectors from dataframes using `$`
5. Calculate basic descriptive statistics using `mean()`, `median()`, `table()` (and more!)

## Datasets

*None!*

## Packages

|Package| Installation|
|:------|:------|
|`tidyverse`|`install.packages("tidyverse")`|

### Glossary

*Creating vectors*

| Function| Description|
|:------|:--------|
| `c("a", "b", "c")` |Create a character vector|
|    `c(1, 2, 3)`| Create a numeric vector|
|    `c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`|    Create a logical vector|

### Examples

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

```

# Tasks

### A - Getting setup

A1. Open your R project. It should already have the folders `0_Data` and `1_Code`. Make sure that all of the data files listed above are contained in the folder

```{r}
# Done!
```

A2. Open a new R script and save it as a new file called `objects_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. The, load the set of packages listed above with `library()`.

### B - Creating vectors

The table below shows a subset of the `baselers` data. In this practical, you will convert this table to R objects and then analyse them!

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data <- baselers[1:10, c("id", "sex", "age", "height", "weight", "income")]

data %>% knitr::kable(format = "markdown", caption = "Data from 10 baselers")
```

B1. Create a numeric vector called `id` that shows the id values. When you finish, print the object to see it!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a numeric vector
XX <- c(XX, XX, XX, XX)
```

B2. Using the `class()` function, check the class of your `id` vector. Is it numeric?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Chexk the class of an object
class(XX)
```

B3. Using the `length()` function, find out the length of your `id` object. Does it have length 10? If not, make sure you defined it correctly!

B4. Create a character vector called `sex` that shows the sex values. Make sure to use quotation marks "" when entering the data to tell R that the data are charcters! When you finish, print the object to see it!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a character vector
XX <- c("XX", "XX", "XX", "XX")
```


B5. Using the `class()` function, check the class of your `sex` vector. Is it character?

B6. Using the `length()` function, find out the length of your `sex` object. Does it have length 10? If not, make sure you defined it correctly!

B7. Using the same steps as before, create the `height`, `weight`, and `income` objects.

...


### C - Functions

C1. Using the `mean()` function, calculate the mean age. It should be XX!

C2. Using the `table()` function, find out how many males and females are in the data. You should find XX males and YY females!

C3. Try calculating the mean value of sex. What happens? Why?

C4. Try calculating the mean weight. What happens? Why?

C5. Look at the help menu for the `mean()` function to look for an argument that will help you with your problem...

C5. Using the correct argument for the mean function, calculate the mean weight ignoring NA values.

...

### D - Creating dataframes

D1. Using the `data.frame()` function, create a dataframe called `baselers_10` that contains each of vectors you just created:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
XX <- data.frame(XX, XX, XX, XX) 
```

D2. Using the `dim()` function, print the number of rows and columns in your dataframe.

D3. Now use the `tibble()` function...

...

### E - Logical Comparisons

...

### F - Coercion
