# A Note on Logical Expressions

.pull-left45[

Conditional statements usually require you to specify **logical expressions**. If they evaluate to `TRUE` the code in the curly brackets is exected.

Note that:

- `>`, `<`, `==`, `>=`, and `<=` are vectorized
- to prevent errors and warnings due to the vectorization use `any()` and `all()`

```{r, eval=TRUE}

# since == is vectorized
# this yields several logicals
head(baselers$sex) == "male"
```

]

.pull-right45[

```{r, eval=TRUE}

# any and all summarize these logicals
any(head(baselers$sex) == "male")

all(head(baselers$sex) == "male")

if (any(head(baselers$sex) == "male")){
  print("Sample contains at least 1 male")
}


```

# Functions - General Structure

.pull-left4[

You can define your own functions in R. You only have to specify:
- a function name
- arguments (and their defaults)
- the function body

Benefits of writing code in functions:
- less typing
- fewer errors
- can be more general

]

.pull-right5[

```{r}
function_name <- function(arg1,
                          arg2 = "default"){
  
  # function body
  
  result <- do_stuff(arg1, arg2)
  
}



```

]


---

# Functions - Return Statement

.pull-left45[

Use `return()` to exit a function early, i.e. before the final line of its definition.


]

.pull-right45[

```{r}
my_mean <- function(x){
  
  # check precondition and
  # if it's not met return NA
  if (!is.numeric(x) | length(x) == 0){
    return(NA)
  }
  
  sum(x) / length(x)
  
}

```

]


---

# Functions - Arguments

.pull-left45[

Functions can take any object as input to arguments. This means also functions or expressions can be passed as arguments.



]

.pull-right45[

```{r}
# function definition
call_fun <- function(dat, fn, cont_nas){
  fn(dat, na.rm = cont_nas)
}

# input a function and additional
# statements
call_fun(dat = baselers$tattoos,
         fn = mean, cont_nas = TRUE)

# input expression as argument
call_fun(dat = baselers$weight /
           (baselers$height / 100) ^2,
         fn = median, cont_nas = TRUE)



```

]

---

# Functions - Error Messages

.pull-left45[

You can define your own errors, warnings or messages.

To do this use `stop()`, `warning()`, `message()`.

- With `stop()`, `warning()`, and `message()` you have to use separate `if` statements if you want to only use them in specific conditions. 


]

.pull-right45[

```{r}
# with stop you test whether stopping
# condition is met
my_mean <- function(x){
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)){
    
    stop("Can only compute mean from
          numeric variable. Your data
          was of class",
         class(x))
    
  } else if (any(is.na(x))){
    
    warning("Return NA because data
             contains NAs.")
  }
  
  sum(x) / length(x)
}


```

]

# Example - `show_stats()`

.pull-left55[

Let's create a function called `show_stats()` which takes a numeric vector as an argument, and returns a sentence with information about that vector

```{r}
show_stats <- function(x, digits = 2) {
  
  if(!is.numeric(x)) {
    
    stop("x is not numeric!!!")}
  
  output <- paste0("x has length ", length(x), 
                  ", and a mean of ", round(mean(x), digits))
  
  output
  
}
```


]

.pull-right4[

```{r}
# Test with a numeric vector
show_stats(x = baselers$age)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Text with a characteer vector
show_stats(x = baselers$sex)
```

<font color = 'red'>Error in show_stats(x = "character!") : x is not numeric!!!</font>

# Iteration - `for` Loops

.pull-left35[

A `for` loop lets you **repeat the execution of a block of code** as many times as you wish. It also allows you to loop through positions.

# Iteration - `for` Loops

.pull-left35[

A for loop lets you repeat the execution of a block of code as many times as you wish. It also allows you to loop through positions.

A `for` loop has three components:

- **output** (object to be prepared before entering the loop)
- **sequence** (defines the vector to loop through)
- **body** (the code that does the actual work)


]

.pull-right6[

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# output:
mean_vec <- vector("double", length = 3)
mean_names <- c("age", "weight", "height")

for (ind in c(1, 2, 3)) { # sequence
  mean_vec[ind] <- mean(baselers[[mean_names[ind]]],
                        na.rm = TRUE) # body
}

# The code to do the same without a loop is
mean(baselers[["age"]], na.rm = TRUE)
mean(baselers[["weight"]], na.rm = TRUE)
mean(baselers[["height"]], na.rm = TRUE)

```

]


---

# Iteration - `while` Loops


.pull-left45[

`while` loops let you iterate until a specified condition is met.

This can be handy, but also "dangerous" because if the condition is never met, it will just iterate until you manually stop it.


]

.pull-right45[


```{r, eval = FALSE}
subs_age <- sample(baselers$age, 30)

# get only baselers over 40
while(any(subs_age <= 40)){
  subs_age <- sample(baselers$age, 30)
}

# Potentially problematic:
# get only baselers over 40
# but with a much larger sample
while(any(subs_age <= 40)){
  subs_age <- sample(baselers$age, 30000)
}
```

]

---

# Iteration - `apply` Family


.pull-left45[

Functions of the `apply` family are another tool to iterate through objects and do the same operation on each subset.

They are very handy, but not always consistently programmed, i.e., for example the argument structure is not always the same.

These are available `apply` functions:

- `apply`
- `lapply`
- `sapply`
- `tapply`
- `vapply`


]

.pull-right5[


```{r}
# structure: data, function, arguments

# lapply: simplest apply version
lapply(baselers[, c("age", "weight")], 
       mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# sapply: apply version that
# simplifies lapply output
sapply(baselers[, c("age", "weight", "height")],
       mean, na.rm = TRUE)

```

]

---

# Iteration - `apply` Family - Anonymous Functions


.pull-left45[


You can specify **anonymous functions** in functions of the `apply` family. 

An anonymous function exists only temporarily when the `apply` function is called. This means that the anonymous function is not defined in a separate step, but directly within the `apply` function.



]

.pull-right5[


```{r, eval = TRUE}

# calculate the mean of
# age, weight, and height
lapply(baselers[, c("age", "weight", "height")],
       function(x, na_rm){
         if (isTRUE(na_rm)){
           x <- x[!is.na(x)]
           }
         sum(x) / length(x)
         
         }, na_rm = TRUE)


```

]

---

# Iteration - `map` Family


.pull-left45[


The `map` functions are the **purrr** equivalent of the `apply` functions.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_image/purrr_hex.png")
```

]

.pull-right5[


```{r}

map(baselers[, c("age", "weight", "height")],
    mean)


```

]

---

# Iteration - `map` Family


.pull-left45[


The `map` functions are the **purrr** equivalent of the `apply` functions.

There are several `map` functions that iterate over one vector. They are named after the type of object they return:

- `map` returns a list
- `map_lgl` returns a logical vector
- `map_int` returns an integer vector
- `map_dbl` returns a double vector
- `map_chr` returns a character vector

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/therbootcamp.github.io/master/_sessions/_image/purrr_hex.png")
```

]

.pull-right45[


```{r}
# Print the mean of several columns

baselers %>%
  select(age,
         weight,
         height)  %>%
  map_dbl(mean, na.rm = TRUE)

```

# Summary - What We've Learned


- How to use conditional statements
- How to program our own functions
- How to iterate over blocks of code

This is very helpful to not having to type the same code many times and to keep it more flexible. Remember the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, i.e. if you have to write the same block of code more than twice, create a function to do so and iterate over it.
