# Tasks

## A - Read delim-separated text files

In this section, you will read in a subset of the well known diamonds data set and prepare it for data analysis. 

1. Identify the file path to the `diamonds.csv` dataset by using the `""` (quotation marks) auto-complete trick. Place the cursor between two quotation marks, hit &#8677; (tab-key), and browse through the file. Save the file path in an object called path.

```{r, eval = F, echo =T}
# place cursor in-between "" and hit tab
path <- ""
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# place cursor in-between and hit tab
path <- "1_Data/diamonds.csv"
```

2. Using `read_csv()` and the `path` object, read the `diamonds.csv` dataset. Make sure to first load the `tidyverse`. 

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# read diamonds data
diamonds <- read_csv(XX)
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# read diamonds data
diamonds <- read_csv(path)
```

3. Print the diamonds data and inspect the column names in the header line. Something's wrong!

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# print diamonds
diamonds
```

4. Fix the header by reading in the data again using the `col_names`-argument. Assign to `col_names` a character vector containing the correct column names: `carat`, `cut`, `color`, `clarity`, `depth`, `table`, `price`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# read diamonds data while specifying col_names
diamonds <- read_csv(XX, col_names = XX)
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# read diamonds data while specifying col_names
diamonds <- read_csv(path,
                     col_names = c("carat", "cut", "color", "clarity", "depth", "table", "price"))
```

5. Re-inspect the header by printing the data. Has the header been fixed?

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# print diamonds
diamonds
```

6. Now pay attention to the classes of the individuals columns (variables). Have all classes been identified correctly? Should `carat` not be a numeric variable?

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# print diamonds
diamonds
```

7. Select and print the `carat` variable to identify the one entry that caused the variable to become a character vector. (hint: look for a comma). 

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# print the carat column
diamonds$carat
```

8. Change the carat variable's element at position `XX` to same value `YY` but with a period instead of a comma. Use the code below.  

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# Change the value at position XX to YY
diamonds$carat[XX] <- YY
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# Change the value at position XX to YY
diamonds$carat[17] <- 0.37
```

9. Now, run `type_convert` on the `diamonds` data to have R re-infer and fix the data types. 

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# re-infer data types
diamonds <- type_convert(diamonds)
```

10. Inspect the message that was printed in the console. Has the type of `carat` changed in `double`? Verify by printing the dataset.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# print diamonds data set
diamonds
```

11. The data is now ready for analysis. Calculate a few statistics. What is the average `carat` or `price` (use `mean()`)? What cut `cut` and `clarity` levels exist and how often do they occur (use `table()`)? You can learn more about the variable values from the help file `?diamonds`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# simple stats of diamonds
mean(diamonds$carat)
mean(diamonds$price)
table(diamonds$cut)
table(diamonds$clarity)
```

## B - Write delim-separated text files

1. Write the, now, properly formatted diamonds data to your data folder as a `.csv` file using the name   `diamonds_clean.csv`. Don't forget to include both the file name and the folder (separated by `/`) in the character string specifying the `path` argument. 

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# write clean diamonds data to disc
write_csv(XX, path = XX)
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# write clean diamonds data to disc
write_csv(diamonds, "1_Data/diamonds_clean.csv")
```

2. Read `diamonds_clean.csv` back in and call the object `diamonds_clean`. Verify that this time the types been correctly identified from the start.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# read clean diamonds data from disc
diamonds_clean <- read_csv("1_Data/diamonds_clean.csv")
```

3. Using `write_delim`, write the data to disc with a different delimiter calling it `diamonds_delim.csv`. Specifically, set the `delim`-argument to `@`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# write with @ as delimiter
write_delim(XX, path = XX, delim = XX)
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# write with @ as delimiter
write_delim(diamonds_clean, path = "1_Data/diamonds_delim.csv", delim = "@")
```

4. Read `diamonds_delim.csv` back in using `read_csv()`. What happens?

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# read @-delimited diamonds data
read_csv("1_Data/diamonds_delim.csv")
```

5. Fix the delimiter issue by using `read_delim()` instead of `read_csv()` and specifying the `delim`-argument. Verify that everything is in order again by printing the data.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# read @-delimited diamonds data
read_delim("1_Data/diamonds_delim.csv", delim = "@")
```

## C - Read other file formats

**Excel**

1. Using `read_excel()`, read in the `titanic.xls` dataset. Make sure to first load the `readxl` package.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
titanic <- read_excel(XX)
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# Read titanic data
titanic <- read_excel("1_Data/titanic.xls")
```

2. Print it and evaluate its dimensions using `dim()`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# print and show dimenisons
titanic
dim(titanic)
```

3. Using `table()`, how many people survived (variable `survived`) in each cabin class (variable `pclass`)?

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# determine survival rate by cabin class
table(titanic$XX, titanic$XX)
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# determine survival rate by cabin class
table(titanic$pclass, titanic$survived)
```

4. Write data to your data folder using `write_csv()`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# write data to .csv
write_csv(titanic, "1_Data/titanic.csv")
```

**SPSS**

5. Using `read_spss()` read in the sleep data set `sleep.sav` of staff at he University of Melbourne. Make sure to first load the `haven` package.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
XX <- read_spss(XX)
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# Read sleep data
sleep <- read_spss("1_Data/sleep.sav")
```

6. Print it and evaluate its dimensions using `dim()`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# print and show dimenisons
sleep
dim(sleep)
```

7. How many drinks do staff at the University of Melbourne consumer per day (variable `alcohol`). Use the `mean()`-function, while taking care of missing values using the `na.rm`-argument. 

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# compute mean number of drinks
mean(sleep, na.rm = TRUE)
```

8. Write data to your data folder using `write_csv()`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# write data to .csv
write_csv(sleep, "1_Data/sleep.csv")
```


**SAS**

9. Using `read_sas()`, read in `airbnb_zuerich.sas7bdat` containing AirBnB listings in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland and call the object `airbnb_zuerich`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# read sas data
XX <- read_sas(XX)
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# read airbnb_zuerich.sas7bdat
airbnb_zuerich <- read_sas("1_Data/airbnb_zuerich.sas7bdat")
```

10. Print it and evaluate its dimensions using `dim()`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# print and show dimenisons
airbnb_zuerich
dim(airbnb_zuerich)
```

11. Using `table()`, determine how many AirBnB listings of which `room_type` exist in ZÃ¼rich?

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# table room type
table(airbnb_zuerich$room_type)
```

12. Write data to your data folder using `write_csv()`.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# write data to .csv
write_csv(airbnb_zuerich, "1_Data/airbnb_zuerich.csv")
```

## D - Use R's data format

R has two data formats of its own - `.Rdata` and `.RDS`. We recommend to use only `.RData` as its use follows the same logic as with other read and write functions. A benefit of using R's data formats is compression, leading to often substantially smaller file sizes. 

1. First, using `read_csv()` read back in the `diamonds_clean.csv` dataset. 

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# read diamonds_clean.csv
diamonds_clean <- read_csv("1_Data/diamonds_clean.csv")
```

2. Using `saveRDS()` write `diamonds_clean` to an Â´.RDSÂ´-file into your data folder. The function works analogue to other write functions. Make sure to use `.RDS` as the file ending.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# write to RDS
saveRDS(XX, file = XX)
```

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# write to RDS
saveRDS(diamonds_clean, file = "1_Data/diamonds_clean.RDS")
```

3. Using `readRDS()`, read `diamonds_clean.RDS` and inspect the data to verify the data has not changed.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# read from RDS
readRDS("1_Data/diamonds_clean.RDS")
```

4. Using `file.size()`, compare the file size of `diamonds_clean.csv` and `diamonds_clean.RDS`. Which file is larger?

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# read from RDS
file.size("1_Data/diamonds_clean.csv")
file.size("1_Data/diamonds_clean.RDS")
```

## X - Scraping the internet

1. Finally on to something completely new. These days a lot of data is available not come in a ready-made, spreadsheet-like form, but must be extracted and processed in order to be used. One such data source is the world wide web. The code below based on the `rvest` and `xml2` packages shows a short example of how to extract a table from R's Wikipedia page. Run the code and experience how easy it is to extract data from a webpage.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# load package
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(xml2)

# get html
url <- 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)' 
page <- read_html(url)

# get raw html table
# use XPath from inspect page (e.g., in Chrome)
table_raw = html_node(page, xpath = '//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/div/table[2]')

# transform to data frame
table <- html_table(table_raw)

# create tibble
as_tibble(table)
```

2. If you like, tweak the code to extract tables from other websites. The only things you need to change is the `url` and the `xpath` location. To extract the latter, use the feature of *Chrome* or *Firefox* to show you the html code for a given webpage element. To access the html code right-click on the website element of interest and select `Inspect` or `Inspect element` depending on whether you use Chrome or Firefox. Next right-click on the currently marked element in the html code pane and select `Copy/Copy XPath` or `Copy/XPath` again depending on the browser. Now, you can insert the `XPath` location into your code using `cmd + v` (Mac) or `ctrl + v`. If the code does not work, you probably selected the wrong element. Look out for an element called, e.g., `<table class="wikitable">`, in the case of *Wikipedia*.
